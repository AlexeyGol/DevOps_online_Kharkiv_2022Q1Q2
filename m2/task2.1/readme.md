## Task 2.1

### Hypervisors

1. KVM, Xen, RHEV, Hyper-V, VMware ESXi, Oracle VM
2. Some of them are open source (KVM, Xen), some of them are commercial (RHEV, Hyper-V, VMware ESXi). 

Hyper-V has insufficient support for Linux. 

VMware price is higher compared to other virtualisation services; It is harder to learn. 

Oracle VM can do live migrations when machines are running and when installing security updates has zero-downtime unlike Hyper-V. 

Xen is relatively cheaper, easier to learn, but has minimal support of USB devices and process of migration from open-source hypervisors is very complex.
